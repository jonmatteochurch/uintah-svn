Scripts in this folder can be used to inspect hypre assembled matrices and
vectors from HYPRE's output files. These are generated only when the macro
PRINTSYSTEM is defined in src/CCA/Components/Solvers/HypreFAC/Solver.h

An example of use script follows

nlevels=2;
rfactor = [1 1;2 2];
s = loadSStructSystem(nlevels,'.','A.0.1','b.0.1','x.0.1','.00000');
plotSStructSystem(s,rfactor,'Demo')
